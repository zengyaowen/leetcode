# [178. Rank Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores)

[中文文档](/solution/0100-0199/0178.Rank%20Scores/README.md)

## Description

<p>Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no &quot;holes&quot; between ranks.</p>

<pre>
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
</pre>

<p>For example, given the above <code>Scores</code> table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):</p>

<pre>
+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
|&nbsp;3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
</pre>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>&nbsp;For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example<strong>&nbsp;`Rank`</strong>.</p>


## Solutions

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **MySQL8**

Use `DENSE_RANK()` to solve this problem.

```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY <expression>[{,<expression>...}]
    ORDER BY <expression> [ASC|DESC], [{,<expression>...}]
)
```

Solution:

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Score, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) 'Rank'
FROM Scores;
```

### **MySQL5**

MySQL only provides [window function](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/window-function-descriptions.html) after version 8. In previous versions, variables can be used to achieve similar functions:

```sql
SELECT Score,
       CONVERT(rk, SIGNED) `Rank`
FROM (SELECT Score,
             IF(@latest = Score, @rank, @rank := @rank + 1) rk,
             @latest := Score
      FROM Scores,
           (SELECT @rank := 0, @latest := NULL) tmp
      ORDER BY Score DESC) s;
```
