# Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers _x_ and _y_, calculate the Hamming distance.

## Example 1:
```
 Input: x = 1, y = 4
 Output: 2
 
 Explanation: 
     1   (0 0 0 1)
     4   (0 1 0 0)
