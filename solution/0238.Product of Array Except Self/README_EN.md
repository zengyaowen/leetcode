# Product of Array Except Self

Given an array **nums** of n integers where _n > 1_, Â return an array **output** such that **output[i]** is equal to the product of all the elements of **nums** except **nums[i]**.


## Example 1:
```
 Input: [1,2,3,4]
 Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Note**: Please solve it without division and in O(n).



**Follow up**:

Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
