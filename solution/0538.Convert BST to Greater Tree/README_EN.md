# Reverse Words in a String III

Given a Binary Search Tree (_BST_), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus **sum** of all keys greater than the original key in _BST_.

## Example:
```
 Input: The root of a Binary Search Tree like this:
               5
             /   \
            2     13
 
 Output: The root of a Greater Tree like this:
              18
             /   \
           20     13
```
