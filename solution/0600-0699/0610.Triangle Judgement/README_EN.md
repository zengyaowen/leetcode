[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0610.Triangle%20Judgement/README.md)

## Description

A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.



<p>&nbsp;</p>

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table <code>triangle</code> holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<pre>

| x  | y  | z  |

|----|----|----|

| 13 | 15 | 30 |

| 10 | 20 | 15 |

</pre>

For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:



<pre>

| x  | y  | z  | triangle |

|----|----|----|----------|

| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |

| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |

</pre>
