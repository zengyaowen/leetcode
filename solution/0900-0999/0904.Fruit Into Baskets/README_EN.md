# [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets)

[中文文档](/solution/0900-0999/0904.Fruit%20Into%20Baskets/README.md)

## Description

<p>You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array <code>fruits</code> where <code>fruits[i]</code> is the <strong>type</strong> of fruit the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> tree produces.</p>

<p>You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You only have <strong>two</strong> baskets, and each basket can only hold a <strong>single type</strong> of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.</li>
	<li>Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick <strong>exactly one fruit</strong> from <strong>every</strong> tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.</li>
	<li>Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the integer array <code>fruits</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of fruits you can pick</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> fruits = [<u>1,2,1</u>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can pick from all 3 trees.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> fruits = [0,<u>1,2,2</u>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> fruits = [1,<u>2,3,2,2</u>]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= fruits.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= fruits[i] &lt; fruits.length</code></li>
</ul>

### **Python3**

```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, tree: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = Counter()
        i = res = 0
        for j, type in enumerate(tree):
            counter[type] += 1
            while len(counter) > 2:
                counter[tree[i]] -= 1
                if counter[tree[i]] == 0:
                    counter.pop(tree[i])
                i += 1
            res = max(res, j - i + 1)
        return res
```

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] tree) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> counter = new HashMap<>();
        int i = 0, res = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < tree.length; ++j) {
            counter.put(tree[j], counter.getOrDefault(tree[j], 0) + 1);
            while (counter.size() > 2) {
                counter.put(tree[i], counter.get(tree[i]) - 1);
                if (counter.get(tree[i]) == 0) {
                    counter.remove(tree[i]);
                }
                ++i;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, j - i + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
